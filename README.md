## Brief Introduction

**This mod adds a planting station and a replicator to Mekanism ( of course there are others ).**

**The factory added oxidizing factory, dissolving factory and so on.**

**However, their models and textures are not very good at present, because it takes a little time to make models, and then with new models, they will be replaced.**

**Because it is not compatible with Kubejs and Crt, if you want to add your own recipes, you can only use the most primitive methods (such as Kubejs' custom). If you want to know the Json format of the corresponding machine, you can check the Wiki on Github.**

## Recycler

**Destroy most useless items or blocks to produce scrap. By default, dirt and stones were added because I don't want you to accidentally throw important things in.**

**Scrap is the basic item for manufacturing UU matter, and if JEI is run, you will see relevant recipes.**

## Planting Station

**Consuming nutrient solution to produce crops, it is compatible with most of the things that can be grown in vanilla and fully compatible with mysticalagriculture.**

## Replicator

**The machine that uses UU matter to replicate items, it does not have a recipe by default, and you need to add the corresponding recipe in the configuration file. I know this may be troublesome, but I think it's necessary.**

## Stamper, Lathe and Rolling Mill

**Some general-purpose machines. At present, only Stamper has linkage IE, AE2 and their accessories. There are no suitable recipes for other machines yet, and perhaps some will be added in the future. If you want to use them, you can add recipes yourself.**

## Advanced Factory

**Have you always felt that machines such as chemical oxidizer are relatively slow. Now they have factory versions, and advanced factories with multiple threads can greatly improve production efficiency.**

**However, they are not yet compatible with Computer Craft, making it difficult to precisely control each slot or tank. But I don't have that much time to study CC's code. If you want to help adapt it, I would like to thank you in advance.**
